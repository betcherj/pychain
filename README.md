##Smart Contracts
Jack Betcher and Peter Bromley 

###Proposal
In this project hope to implement a block chain based smart contract in order to learn
associated new concepts and technologies. We plan to use a python implementation of the block chain 
as well as Flask with postman for our API interaction. The nodes of our block chain will contain signed
documents allowing for verifiable contracts without the need for a third party.
